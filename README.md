## Step 1

I started by creating a Next.js app using ```create-next-app```:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, I filled the following prompts:

```bash
What is your project named? my-app // Xeventy2.0
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes // Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes // Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes // Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes // Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes // Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes // Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes // No
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

I realized Next.js caches on the front-end automatically and does not require
manual caching.
